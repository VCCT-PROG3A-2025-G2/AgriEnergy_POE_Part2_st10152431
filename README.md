*****Functionality and User Roles*****
When a user first enters the website the are met with a creative homepage that encapsulates the core functions of that website as well as their goals and navigation links to different parts of the website (these links wont work before logging in)â€¦

The other existing page is the 'User Profile' page. Initially this page will have 3 input blocks... one for new customers, one for existing customers and one for employees. If a new customer registers, or a old one logs in, they will have almost full access to the website. After they register or log in the customer will have 2 more navigation options. They can now view all products in the marketplace, added by all farmers registered with AgriEnergy, and they can start adding products of their own. They can also now navigate to the resource centre and read information on products they might like or talk to other farmers to share opinions and farming techniques. farmers can also navigate back to user-profile to log out 

If a user logs in as an employee with the correct access code (1234 in this case) they can  also see 2 new navigation screens, 'manage farmers' and 'manage products'. On the Manage farmers page an employee can add a new customer as well as edit and delete existing customers. They also now have the Manage Products screen that displays all information about all products... here they can also edit or delete any product as well as filter them according to 'category', 'date', and 'farmer'. They can also use the user profile navigation to log out.
